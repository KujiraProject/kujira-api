In case you want to get access to graphite-web you have to do following instructions:

7. change /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Listen 80
add line
Listen 81

and change in /etc/httpd/conf.d/graphite-vhost.conf

<VirtualHost *:80>
change to
<VirtualHost *:81> Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, OPTIONS"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "origin, authorization, accept"

between <Directory> element
<Directory "/usr/share/graphite/"> 
Options All
AllowOverride All
Require all granted
</Directory>

8. systemctl restart httpd

now you can access to grafana and graphite-web by web browser by following ips:
graphite-web - 127.0.0.1:81
grafana 127.0.0.1:3000

remember to forward ports in virtual host if you want to get access on host
